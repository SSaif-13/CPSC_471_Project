## üõ† Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Vite

**Backend:** Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL

**Deployment & Infrastructure:** Docker, Microsoft Azure


## Installation
### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL (v14+ recommended) 
- Docker
- Microsoft Azure account (for database deployment)

### üîß Local Development Setup
First, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSaif-13/CPSC_471_Project
cd my-project
```
Install dependencies in your root directory for the project:
```bash
npm install my-project
```

Then, install dependencies in the server directory:
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

Setup the Azure database using the *setup.sql* script provided in the server directory. Use an external tool such as psql CLI, and run the following command:

```psql
psql \
  --host=<your-server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com \
  --username=<admin-username>@<your-server-name> \
  --dbname=postgres \
  -a -f setup.sql
```

You will also need to setup an .env file which needs to be placed in your project's root directory. It should look something like this:
```env
DB_HOST=<your-server-name>.postgres.database.azure.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=<your-database-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
```

### üê≥ Docker Deployment
Run the following command to build and run the app's container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To stop the app's container, either use Docker desktop or run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

If everything succeeds, you should see the following messages in the logs:
- Frontend:
    ```
    Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    Network: http://(your network IP):5173/
    ```
- Backend:
    ```
    Available databases: [ '(your available databases)' ]
    Connected to database: (database you are connected to)
    Connected as user: (your user)
    Server running on port 5000
    Test endpoint available at http://localhost:5000/api/test‚Å†
    API routes available under http://localhost:5000/api‚Å†
    ```
